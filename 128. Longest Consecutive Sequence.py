'''
Given an unsorted array of integers nums, return the length of the longest consecutive elements sequence.

You must write an algorithm that runs in O(n) time.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [100,4,200,1,3,2]
Output: 4
Explanation: The longest consecutive elements sequence is [1, 2, 3, 4]. Therefore its length is 4.
Example 2:

Input: nums = [0,3,7,2,5,8,4,6,0,1]
Output: 9
 

Constraints:

0 <= nums.length <= 105
-109 <= nums[i] <= 109

class Solution:
    def longestConsecutive(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        longest = 0
        num_set = set(nums)

        for n in num_set:
            if (n-1) not in num_set:
                length = 1
                while (n+length) in num_set:
                    length += 1
                longest = max(longest, length)

        return longest
