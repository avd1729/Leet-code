'''
An ugly number is a positive integer whose prime factors are limited to 2, 3, and 5.

Given an integer n, return the nth ugly number.

 

Example 1:

Input: n = 10
Output: 12
Explanation: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12] is the sequence of the first 10 ugly numbers.
Example 2:

Input: n = 1
Output: 1
Explanation: 1 has no prime factors, therefore all of its prime factors are limited to 2, 3, and 5.
 

Constraints:

1 <= n <= 1690

class Solution:
    def nthUglyNumber(self, n: int) -> int:
        k = [0] * n
        t1 = t2 = t3 = 0
        k[0] = 1
        for i in range(1, n):
            k[i] = min(k[t1]*2, k[t2]*3, k[t3]*5)
            if (k[i] == k[t1]*2):
                t1 += 1
            if (k[i] == k[t2]*3):
                t2 += 1
            if (k[i] == k[t3]*5):
                t3 += 1
        return k[n-1]
