'''
Given two strings needle and haystack, return the index of the first occurrence of needle in haystack, or -1 if needle is not part of haystack.

 

Example 1:

Input: haystack = "sadbutsad", needle = "sad"
Output: 0
Explanation: "sad" occurs at index 0 and 6.
The first occurrence is at index 0, so we return 0.
Example 2:

Input: haystack = "leetcode", needle = "leeto"
Output: -1
Explanation: "leeto" did not occur in "leetcode", so we return -1.
 

Constraints:

1 <= haystack.length, needle.length <= 104
haystack and needle consist of only lowercase English characters.

    def strStr(self, haystack: str, needle: str) -> int:
        N, H = len(needle), len(haystack)

        for i in range(H - N + 1):
            for j in range(N):
                if needle[j] != haystack[i + j]:
                    break
                if j == N - 1:
                    return i

        return -1
