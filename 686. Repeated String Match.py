'''
Given two strings a and b, return the minimum number of times you should repeat string a so that string b is a substring of it. If it is impossible for b​​​​​​ to be a substring of a after repeating it, return -1.

Notice: string "abc" repeated 0 times is "", repeated 1 time is "abc" and repeated 2 times is "abcabc".

 

Example 1:

Input: a = "abcd", b = "cdabcdab"
Output: 3
Explanation: We return 3 because by repeating a three times "abcdabcdabcd", b is a substring of it.
Example 2:

Input: a = "a", b = "aa"
Output: 2
 

Constraints:

1 <= a.length, b.length <= 104
a and b consist of lowercase English letters.

class Solution:
    def repeatedStringMatch(self, a: str, b: str) -> int:
        for i in range(len(b)//len(a), len(b)//len(a)+3):
            if b in a*(i):
                return i
        return -1
